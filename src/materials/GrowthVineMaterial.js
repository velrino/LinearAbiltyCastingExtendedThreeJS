/**
 * The wild growth — layers 2 and 3 of the breakdown, in one file because they
 * are one shape.
 *
 * A leaf is not decoration scattered near a tendril: it is **clipped to** it.
 * Both materials include the same `vinePoint` / `vineFrame` / `vineRadius`
 * block and are handed the same uniform boxes by identity, so a leaf resolves
 * the exact stem position the tube resolved, on the same frame, from the same
 * numbers. Drag `curl turns` while a summon is standing and the foliage curls
 * with the wood. There is no other way to keep several hundred leaves welded to
 * fourteen animated stems without either baking the stems (and losing the live
 * controls) or reading geometry back off the GPU (and losing the frame).
 *
 * ## Why these are lit materials and not raw shaders
 *
 * Everything else this project draws in the air is additive and unlit, which is
 * right for fire and lightning. Wood is not light — it is *matter*, and matter
 * that does not sit in the sun, take a shadow, occlude what is behind it and
 * pick up the probe reads as a decal wrapped around the scene however good its
 * silhouette is. So the tendrils and the foliage are `MeshStandardMaterial`
 * with their vertex stage replaced: the shading model is three's, the geometry
 * is ours.
 *
 * Two consequences fall out of that and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **the shadow pass needs the same vertex stage.** A depth material built
 *    from the untouched geometry would rasterise a flat sheet of parameter
 *    space somewhere near the origin, so `createVineMaterial` hands back a
 *    matching `MeshDepthMaterial` for the mesh's `customDepthMaterial`.
 *  - **the model matrix must be identity.** The vertex stage writes *world*
 *    positions into `transformed`, so the ability's group and both meshes are
 *    left at the origin, unrotated and unscaled. Move either and the summon
 *    moves twice.
 *
 * @see GrowthGeometry.js for the buffers these run on.
