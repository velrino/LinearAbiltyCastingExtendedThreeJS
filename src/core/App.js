   * are lazy, so at that point not one ability object existed and there was
   * nothing of theirs to compile.
   *
   * The second would have bitten even if they had been: **three compiles a
   * program for the state a material is drawn in, and `compile` guesses that
   * state from the render target that happens to be bound.** The program cache
   * key carries `outputColorSpace` and `toneMapping`, and both differ between
   * drawing to the canvas (sRGB, ACES) and drawing into the composer's HDR
   * target (linear, none) — which is the only way this app ever draws. Every
   * program that call produced was keyed for a render that never happens, and
   * was compiled a second time on the first real frame. The light counts have
   * the same problem: the distortion pass renders with the camera restricted to
   * one layer, so its materials want a *no point lights* variant that a compile
   * against the full camera never asks for.
   *
   * So the warm-up is a real frame from the real pipeline instead — depth
   * prepass, distortion pass, shadow map, composer — with the ability revealed
   * inside it. That pays up front, one ability at a time, for everything the
   * first cast used to pay for mid-fight: the geometry generation, the program
   * compiles for all four passes, and the first upload of every vertex buffer.
