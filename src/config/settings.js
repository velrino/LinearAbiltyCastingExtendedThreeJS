/**
 * settings.js — the single source of truth for every tweakable value in the sandbox.
 *
 * Nothing in the renderer owns state that lives here: shaders, particle systems,
 * lights and post processing all *read* these objects every frame. That is what
 * makes the real-time editor work without rebuilding anything — mutating a field
 * is immediately visible on screen, including on a ward that is already
 * standing, and including while the clock is paused (`P`), which is when the
 * shapes are actually worth tuning.
 *
 * The one rule that keeps that promise: a system may only ever *sample* these
 * values. It must never copy one into a record at spawn time and read it back
 * later — see `WardAbility`, whose monolith records hold nothing but unitless
 * dice rolls, and resolve every metre, radian and second against this file each
 * frame.
 *
 * Conventions
 *  - Colours are stored as `#rrggbb` strings so lil-gui can bind them directly.
 *    Use `utils/color.js#getColor()` to read them as a cached THREE.Color.
 *  - `global` holds multipliers that scale everything at once (1 = neutral).
 *  - The per-ability blocks (`ward`, `acid`, `growth`, `cyber`, …) hold absolute values.
 *
 * Every ability block is keyed by its id in `ELEMENTS`, and the shared systems
 * that need to know about "the ability the player is currently holding" — the
 * aim controller, the cooldown, the HUD — look it up as `settings[element]`.
 * The four fields they rely on being present are `range`, `minRange`, `speed`
 * and `cooldown`; everything else in a block is that ability's own business.
 * A **far cast** (`CastShape.ZONE`, declared in `ELEMENT_META`) adds a fifth:
 * `zoneRadius`, the footprint the circle indicator measures out.
 */

/**
 * The cast animations shipped alongside the rig, in `public/models/<id>.fbx`.
 *
 * Every ability block carries a `castAnim` naming one of these, so each spell
 * can throw the body differently; `CharacterController` loads all of them once
 * at boot and keeps only their clips, and the editor turns this array straight
 * into the per-ability dropdown.

   * VOLCANIC HORROR WARD. A surge of melt runs to the aimed circle, the stone
   * inside it shatters into plates with magma in the seams, a ring of obsidian
   * monoliths is heaved up out of the wreckage, and a cylinder of blood closes
   * over the lot with a band of burning runes at its foot and another at its rim.
   *
   * The **heartbeat** is the idea the whole ability is built on. One two-lobe
   * cardiac envelope is evaluated per frame in `WardAbility` (`bpm`, `beatDepth`)
   * and handed to *everything*: the membrane swells and brightens on it, the
   * runes flare, the veins under the obsidian light from the floor up as the
   * wave climbs, the melt in the seams pumps, the core flare relights, the
   * dynamic light throbs and a ring of embers is thrown off the stone. Nothing
   * in here free-runs on its own sine — that is the difference between a stack
   * of effects and one thing that is alive.
   *
   * The eight passes of the reference sheet map onto the groups below one for
   * one:
   *
   *   1. cylindrical blood barrier  → `The barrier`     (WardBarrierMaterial)
   *   2. magma fracture decal       → `The floor`       (WardGroundMaterial)
   *   3. rising obsidian embers     → `Embers & ash`
   *   4. gore splash particles      → `Gore`
   *   5. core heat distortion       → `Heat haze`       (LAYER.DISTORTION)
   *   6. rune edge glow             → `The rune bands`
   *   7. sub-surface vein flash     → `The obsidian`    (ObsidianMaterial)
   *   8. lens flare shockwave       → `The core flare`
   *
   * The first **far cast**, so `zoneRadius` is the one number that really
   * matters: it is where the membrane stands, where the rune bands run, where
   * the floor stops shattering and where the monoliths are seated.
   *
   * As everywhere else in this file, a cast captures a seed and a handful of
   * timestamps and nothing else. Every metre, radian and second below is
   * re-resolved each frame, including on a zero-length one — which is why the
   * ward reshapes under these sliders with the clock stopped.

  /**
   * A summon rather than a strike, and the only ability in the set that
   * *chooses* what it hits.
   *
   * A seed of green light runs across the floor to the aimed circle. A nature
   * sigil opens there and races out to the boundary; a nest of woody tendrils
   * tears up out of it, climbing and curling, unfurling foliage as the growth
   * front passes; and an arcane bloom rises out of the middle of them and opens,
   * whorl by whorl, over a core that is visibly winding up. Then it fires: a
   * lance of green light to the nearest body still standing, one at a time,
   * and what it goes through comes apart at the waist.
   *
   * Five layers, one per panel of the reference sheet:
   *
   *   1. **the nature sigil** — SDF rails, a generated rune band, an inscribed
   *      star and a wandering vine filigree, all in metres from the centre so
   *      the mark re-scales rather than stretching.
   *      (`materials/NatureSigilMaterial.js`)
   *   2. **the wild-growth tendrils** — instanced tubes placed entirely in a
   *      vertex shader from an analytic path, lit and shadow casting.
   *      (`materials/GrowthVineMaterial.js`)
   *   3. **the foliage** — instanced leaves clipped to those same stems by the
   *      same path function, so they can never come loose from the wood.
   *   4. **the arcane bloom** — three whorls of petals on an arc, opening by
   *      animating one angle, over an additive core and its halo.
   *      (`materials/ArcaneBloomMaterial.js`)
   *   5. **motes, pollen and mist** — GPU particles, plus the leaves that drift
   *      off the nest as it withers.
   *
   * And the lance, which is layer six in everything but the reference sheet:
   * `materials/GrowthLanceMaterial.js`, one instance per shot, and the cut
   * itself in `settings.slice`.
   *
   * **The rule that keeps the editor honest.** A cast captures a seed and a
   * handful of timestamps. Not one metre, radian or second is recorded: the
   * footprint, the nest, the bloom, the lances and the light are all resolved
   * against this block inside the update loop, which runs on a zero-length
   * frame too. Drag `footprint radius` while a summon is standing and the
   * sigil, the tendrils, the foliage and the bloom all re-seat around it.

   * `materials/CyberSerpentMaterial.js`.
   *
   * Five layers, and the block below is grouped in the order they are drawn:
   *
   *   1. the construct        → `The wireframe`   (WIRE pass)
   *   2. the energy inside it → `The energy fill` (FILL + AURA passes)

   *   4. the wake             → `The wake`        (lagged copies + vapour)
   *   5. the rune board       → `The rune board`  (a routed circuit on the floor)
   *
   * Two conventions worth knowing before dragging anything:
   *
   *  - anything named for the **body** is in *canonical* units, where 1 is the
   *    whole length of the serpent. `sway`, `fillInflate`, `ghostLag` and
   *    `shatterSpread` all scale with `bodyLength` for free, which is why
   *    lengthening the animal does not also have to re-tune its swim.
   *  - anything named for the **board** or the **ribbons** is in metres, because
   *    those are laid out against the cast, not against the animal.

  /**
   * A seam of amethyst tearing along the aimed line and opening into a
   * starburst at the far end. Reference for the look: the five-panel VFX
   * breakdown sheet — crystals, gas, droplets, cracks, glow — and this block is
   * grouped in exactly those five sections so that a panel of the sheet and a
   * folder of the editor are the same thing.
   *
   * Two units are in play, and mixing them up is the only way to get lost here:
   *
   *  - anything about the **cast** is in metres, because it is laid out against
   *    the aim indicator — `width`, `height`, `burstRadius`, `plateRadius`;
   *  - anything about the **plate** is a fraction of its own radius, because the
   *    Voronoi is cut in unit space and scaled — `slabGap`, `slabHeave`,
   *    `slabDepth`. That is what lets a two-metre crater and an eight-metre one
   *    break the same way instead of one of them looking like gravel.
   *
   * The palette is the load-bearing decision and it is worth stating plainly:
   * the stone is **purple** and the light inside it is **green**. Every colour
   * below is chosen against that split, and swapping the two — a green gem with
   * a violet glow — reads as a lamp behind glass instead of poison sealed in a
   * crystal.

   * the rend does to a body.

   * nearly every horizontal length is a multiple of it; `pillarHeight` sets the
   * vertical and the star, the halos and the shard ceiling all seat off it; and
   * `chargeTime` sets how long the shards have to come in before the mark goes
   * off, which is the entire pacing of the piece. All three are live: drag one
   * while a cascade is standing and every layer re-seats around it, paused or
